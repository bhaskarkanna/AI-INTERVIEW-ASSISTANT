# AI-Powered Interview Assistant

A React application that provides an AI-powered interview experience for both candidates and interviewers. Built for the Swipe Internship Assignment.

## 🚨 Important: API Rate Limits

**Current Status**: The application may encounter OpenAI API rate limits during testing. This is normal and expected behavior.

### ✅ What Works Without API
- **Resume Parsing**: Regex-based extraction of Name, Email, Phone
- **Interview Questions**: Pre-defined questions for all difficulty levels
- **Answer Evaluation**: Basic scoring system
- **All Core Features**: Complete interview experience
- **Data Persistence**: All candidate data saved locally

### 🤖 AI Features (When API Available)
- **Smart Resume Analysis**: AI-powered data extraction
- **Dynamic Questions**: Personalized questions based on resume
- **Advanced Evaluation**: AI-powered answer scoring
- **Intelligent Summaries**: AI-generated candidate assessments

### 🔧 Solutions for API Issues

1. **Use Fallback Mode**: The app automatically switches to offline mode
2. **Add API Credits**: Get OpenAI credits for full AI features
3. **Wait for Reset**: Rate limits reset automatically
4. **Test Core Features**: All requirements work without AI

## Features
